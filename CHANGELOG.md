## [1.0.2] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- **S3 Presigned URL Upload**: New `generatePresignedPutUrl` methods for direct client-side uploads
  - Support for content type, metadata, and storage class options
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 4 test scenarios
  - Detailed Korean documentation with usage examples
